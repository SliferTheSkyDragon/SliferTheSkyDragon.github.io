                Generally, Golden Promo's are decided by Gopi. For Birthdays, they are decided by the birthday of the staff member. Shiny <img src="shiny.png" alt="[pkb]" class="common"> Patreon supporters also have the ability to decide Golden <img src="golden.png" alt="[pkb]" class="common"> Promo's (for milestone/holiday promos only).<br/>

                Active contributors with meaningful contributions to suggestions/bug reports/helping others or activity in #general will be put into consideration for codes and the active trainer role by server staff.  As a MINIMUM requirement, you need to have spent at least 7 days (probably closer to a month since the server is growing fast) in the support server to have a chance at being considered. Note: Time spent in this server does not necessarily mean that you will get the role.<br/>
                <br/>
                There are limits to how many codes will be given out for specific Pokemon. They are given out arbitrarily to users (could be multiple gifts in a day, 1 gift a week, or even just 1 gift a month depending on activity). The requirements for active trainer will likely see an increase as the server grows.<br/>
                <br/>
                Do not beg for codes or argue why you deserve codes. If you are a consistent contributor to the support server and a frequent user of the bot in this server, you will eventually receive one for your dedication.<br/>
